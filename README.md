As we all are familiar with the concept of the game. In this game, we have two players. In our program, player 1 will be the user, and player 2 will be the computer. Player 1 selects either rock, paper, or scissor. The computer does not know about what player 1 has selected, so the computer randomly selects any item (rock, paper, or scissor).
The following are the rules of the game:
1. rock vs. scissors -> rock wins
2. paper vs. scissors -> scissors wins
3. paper vs. rock -> paper wins
